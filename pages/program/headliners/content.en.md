Holger’s speech— «Re-inventing Python packaging and testing»: Python still does not have a built-in installer that can install dependencies.  You have to first install setuptools/distribute and then use easy_install/pip.  Installation of packages is slow and depends on reachability of  pypi.python.org and other servers.  There is no quality control where you could e. g. see on which platforms the package successfully installs, let alone has its automated tests passing.  There is not really a standard way to run tests.  This talk outlines my plans for improving the situation, including a demo of a new (in-development) PyPI server that speeds up installation by an order of magnitude for many packages.

"I'll talk about what I see as a successful scaling strategy for growing companies. Specifically it will focus on things you should avoid early on, and where you can get easy
wins. Additionally I'll cover various high level components of an early scaling strategy such as database sharding, CDN caching, and overall architecture to simplify the
growing pains."
