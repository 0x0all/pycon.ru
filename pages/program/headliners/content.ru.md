The Sorry State of SSL

Those web pages with shiny lock icons boasting that your data is safe because of “256 bit encryption”? They are lying. In times of mass surveillance and commercialized Internet crime you should know why that’s the case. This talk will give you an overview that will help you to assess your personal security more realistically and to make your applications as secure as possible against all odds.

The rule of thumb for people without degrees in cryptography on securing data on the Internet is “GPG for data at rest. TLS for data in motion”. And it’s actually a very good rule everyone should follow.

The only kicker though is that configuring (and using!) TLS properly is not as simple as it sounds and if you’re not diligent as a user, developer, and ops engineer, you can easily compromise your data’s security despite best effort of everyone else.

This talk will be multifaceted; you will learn:

- how SSL and TLS roughly work and why their state is sorry,
- server- and client-side duties for best possible security,
- what alternatives you have for using TLS in Python,
- things to keep in mind when configuring servers,
- and what perils outside your control still can trip you up.

In other words, the leitmotif is to show you the most common traps you should know about when using and deploying applications relying on TLS for transport layer security and how to avoid them.

![Honza_Kral](http://dropbucket.ru/pyconru/HonzaKral) Honza Král, Developer at Elasticsearch

We will walk through ElasticSearch features targeted towards data exploration and analysis and show how you can use them to gain insight into your data and your users' behavior and how Elasticsearch allows you to build powerful real-time dashboards for your users. We will use real-life, publicly available data sets and open source tools. Every attendee should walk away with a clear understanding on what Elasticsearch can do with their data, what tools are available out of the box and how to extend them or creating custom ones.
