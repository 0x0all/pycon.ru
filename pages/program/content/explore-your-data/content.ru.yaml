title: Explore your data

description: |
    In this talk I would like to show you a few use-cases where Elasticsearch can help your applications. We will start with the most basic use case of searching for documents and move on to more advanced topics such as faceted navigation and structured search.
    I would like to demonstrate that the very same tool and dataset can be used for real-time analytics (topic distribution, publishing frequency, most popular or commented on content) and data mining in a distributed environment capable of handling terabyte-sized datasets.
    Finally we will demonstrate how Elasticsearch can provide the infrastructure for features beyond search, such as automatic content categorization, user-defined categories or even real-time alerts.
    Attendees should walk away with a good understanding of what Elasticsearch can bring them and where it is a good fit.
