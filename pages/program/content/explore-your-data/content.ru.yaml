title: Explore your data

description: |
    We will walk through ElasticSearch features targeted towards data exploration and analysis and show how you can use them to gain insight into your data and your users' behavior and how Elasticsearch allows you to build powerful real-time dashboards for your users. We will use real-life, publicly available data sets and open source tools. Every attendee should walk away with a clear understanding on what Elasticsearch can do with their data, what tools are available out of the box and how to extend them or creating custom ones.
